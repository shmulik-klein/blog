### About
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shmulik, a senior software engineer at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com), where I get to play with [Qodana](https://www.jetbrains.com/qodana/) and [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) all day. 

This blog is my way of pretending to be organized while actually documenting my coding adventures.

Reach out to me if you're feeling social. Enjoy the chaos!
